## Instalation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements. 
<br>

or

## Be sure that:

<br>
1. Your're using python 3.10 or higher,
<br>
2. Your repositorty has been cloned to ~/Destkop location if not, switch directory in <u></u>libraries/prepare_df.py</u>
